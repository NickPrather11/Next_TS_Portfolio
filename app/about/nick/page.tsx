      <p>
        Nick Prather is a web developer, multi-instrumentalist musician,
        recording engineer, writer, and artist. Nick completed a Bachelor of
        Science in Music Technology from the University of North Carolina at
        Asheville in 2010, with a dual focus on Electronic Music Composition and
        Jazz Studies. He has worked in virtually every facet of the music
        industry: performing, composing, recording, teaching, instrument
        building and repair, equipment sales, studio consulting, and event
        management.

        After completing a 6-month, in-person Full Stack Web Development
        Bootcamp at UNC Chapel Hill in 2019, he has been applying his talents,
        creativity, and focus to the world of web and software application
        development. From February 2020 until April 2024, he worked for
        Field2Base, Inc., an enterprise app development company located in the
        RTP area of North Carolina. Starting out as a Technical Implementation
        Engineer in the Professional Services (P.S.) Department, he utilized the
        Javascript and SQL coding skills he learned in bootcamp and quickly
        adapted to the demands of a client-facing project implementation
        position, while mastering the proprietary technology offered by
        Field2Base. By 2022, he was promoted to Senior P.S. Engineer after
        taking on more internal projects, including the creation of a suite of
        tutorial videos and interdepartmental process development, in addition
        to continued client-focused duties. By May of 2023, he had become P.S.
        Team Lead, the de facto Department Manager. This new position allowed
        Nick to grow as a leader who managed people, projects, and processes,
        sharing his expertise with the next generation of Technical
        Implementation Engineers.

        Having made the difficult decision to leave his career at Field2Base in
        March 2024, Nick has spent his time since focusing on personal and
        professional growth. This includes continuing to learn and apply new web
        development technologies (as exemplified by this website), working on
        art and music projects, and occasionally consulting for a few audio
        equipment manufacturing startups.
