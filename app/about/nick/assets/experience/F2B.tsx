        From February 2020 until April 2024 Nick worked for Field2Base, Inc., an
        enterprise app development company located in Morrisville, North
        Carolina. Field2Base&apos;s services include data collection and
        workflow process optimization by converting clients&apos; paper forms
        into electronic forms accessed via the Field2Base Mobile Forms App. The
        "eForms" are created in F2B&apos;s proprietary Forms Designer software,
        which is used to apply UI elements and allows UI logic to be added via
        JavaScript. The data submitted in these eForms can be transformed with
        XML Workflow Definitions and sent to the F2B Integration engine to be
        downloaded by clients via remote F2B Integration software suite
        installations. Data can also be sent to an analytics database, delivered
        in custom HTML email templates, and used to pre-populate other eForms.
        The submitted forms and the data they contain are then accessed on the
        Field2Base Web Portal. Submitted data can be viewed in analytics
        dashboards created in Sisense/Periscope using SQL queries and Sisense
        GUIs.
        <br></br>

        Starting out as a Technical Implementation Engineer in the Professional
        Services (P.S.) Department, he utilized the Javascript and SQL skills he
        learned in bootcamp and quickly adapted to the demands of a
        client-facing project implementation position, while mastering the
        proprietary technology offered by Field2Base. By 2022, he was promoted
        to Senior P.S. Engineer after taking on more internal projects,
        including the production of a suite of tutorial videos, documentation of
        best practices and S.O.P.&apos;s, and interdepartmental process
        development, in addition to continued client-focused duties. In May of
        2023, he became P.S. Team Lead, the de facto Department Manager. This
        new position allowed Nick to grow as a leader who managed people,
        projects, and processes, sharing his expertise with the next generation
        of Technical Implementation Engineers.

          Having made the difficult decision to leave his career at Field2Base
          in March 2024, Nick has spent his time since focusing on personal and
          professional growth. This includes continuing to learn and apply new
          web development technologies (as exemplified by this website), working
          on art and music projects, and occasionally consulting for a few audio
          equipment manufacturing startups.
